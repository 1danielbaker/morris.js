# Morris.js - pretty time-series line graphs

Morris.js is the library that powers the graphs on http://howmanyleft.co.uk/.

This is a hugely pre-alpha release.  It's a verbatim copy of the code fragment that's in use on *How Many Left*, so it's not really generically usable.  Expect that to improve soon.

Cheers!
